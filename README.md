## ASP.NET MVC 5 
Roadmap of projects/tutorials/courses related to ASP.NET MVC I plan to do.  

*MVC* stands for model-view-controller. MVC is a pattern for developing applications that are well architected, testable and easy to maintain. MVC-based applications contain:
* **M** odels: Classes that represent the data of the application and that use validation logic to enforce business rules for that data.
* **V** iews: Template files that your application uses to dynamically generate HTML responses.
* **C** ontrollers: Classes that handle incoming browser requests, retrieve model data, and then specify view templates that return a response to the browser.

*About ASP.NET MVC*: It gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.
